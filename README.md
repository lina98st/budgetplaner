# Budget Planner


🔗 Live Demo: https://lina98st.github.io/budgetplaner/


A simple budget planner web application built with Vue 3.

The app allows users to track income and expenses, calculate totals, and see their current balance. All data is stored locally in the browser using localStorage.

This project was originally created as one of my first Vue applications.  
At the time, the entire app logic lived in a single file.

As part of a later refactoring, the codebase was cleaned up and restructured:
- the app was split into reusable Vue components
- responsibilities were separated for better readability and maintainability
- naming and structure were improved without changing core functionality


## Features

- Add income and expense entries
- Categorize transactions
- Automatic calculation of total income, total expenses, and balance
- Persistent data storage via localStorage
- Component-based architecture (refactored)

## Tech Stack

- Vue 3
- Vite
- JavaScript
- HTML & CSS

## Project Status

The project is functional and intentionally kept simple.  
Its main purpose is to demonstrate learning progress, refactoring, and clean component structure in Vue.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
